## Hello!
I am a Computer Science student from Copenhagen, Denmark. When I am not studying directly,
I like to spend my time making projects that are usually somewhat related to my current field of study.
Here you'll find a list of my projects, along with the occasional post about cool stuff I've learned while developing them.

I've mostly been working with the following technologies:
 - Java
 - Spring & Spring Boot
 - HTML & CSS
 - MySQL
